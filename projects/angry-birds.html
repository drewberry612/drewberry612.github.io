            <p>For this project, I created an Angry Birds clone using Java and JBox2D. The game follows the same core mechanics as the popular mobile game, where players use a slingshot and birds to destroy structures housing green pigs that have stolen their eggs.</p>

            <div id="video-description" class="video-description">This video showcases the full gameplay of my Angry Birds clone. The footage features menu transitions and complete playthroughs of Levels 2 and 3, along with most of Level 1. Sound effects from the original game are included, bringing the experience to life. Each level was custom-designed to demonstrate increasing complexity in structure and gameplay mechanics. The physics interactions—powered by a bespoke engine using ContactListener logic—accurately simulate collisions between birds, materials, and targets. With four unique bird types, destructible structures made from wood, stone, and glass, and interactive elements like explosives and ropes, the game captures the spirit of the original while adding original design touches. A scoring system rewards efficient play, and the overall experience balances challenge with nostalgic charm.</div>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 Levels:</strong> The game includes 3 levels designed by me, showcasing the core gameplay mechanics of Angry Birds. Each level increases in complexity, providing a fun and challenging experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Physics Engine:</strong> I implemented my own bespoke physics engine using JBox2D. I utilised a ContactListener to create a realistic interaction between the slingshot, birds, and destructible objects. This makes the gameplay feel almost identical to the original game.</li>
                <li><strong>Bird Types:</strong> There are 4 types of birds, each with their own unique abilities. These birds can be launched using the slingshot to hit targets, and each one impacts the structures differently.</li>
                <li><strong>Pig Types:</strong> I included 2 types of pigs, with varying resistance to destruction. The pigs act as the primary targets for the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Destructible Materials:</strong> The game has 3 types of materials for building structures, each with its own unique properties, such as wood, stone, and ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Explosives & Ropes:</strong> Explosives can be triggered by hitting them at the right speed, while ropes allow for more complex and creative structures to be built by the pigs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> The game encourages efficiency, with a scoring system that rewards players for using fewer birds to destroy all the pigs. A timer tracks the optimal time for each level, promoting competitive play.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h2>Audio and Visuals</h2>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> The game includes sound effects taken from the original Angry Birds game, playing when collisions occur or actions are made by the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> I recreated retro-style visuals, giving the game a similar look and feel to the original while adding my own touch for a unique experience.</li>
            </ul>
