            <p>For this project, I created an Angry Birds clone using Java and JBox2D. The game follows the same core mechanics as the popular mobile game, where players use a slingshot and birds to destroy structures housing green pigs that have stolen their eggs.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 Levels:</strong> The game includes 3 levels designed by me, showcasing the core gameplay mechanics of Angry Birds. Each level increases in complexity, providing a fun and challenging experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Physics Engine:</strong> I implemented my own bespoke physics engine using JBox2D. I utilised a ContactListener to create a realistic interaction between the slingshot, birds, and destructible objects. This makes the gameplay feel almost identical to the original game.</li>
                <li><strong>Bird Types:</strong> There are 4 types of birds, each with their own unique abilities. These birds can be launched using the slingshot to hit targets, and each one impacts the structures differently.</li>
                <li><strong>Pig Types:</strong> I included 2 types of pigs, with varying resistance to destruction. The pigs act as the primary targets for the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Destructible Materials:</strong> The game has 3 types of materials for building structures, each with its own unique properties, such as wood, stone, and ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Explosives & Ropes:</strong> Explosives can be triggered by hitting them at the right speed, while ropes allow for more complex and creative structures to be built by the pigs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> The game encourages efficiency, with a scoring system that rewards players for using fewer birds to destroy all the pigs. A timer tracks the optimal time for each level, promoting competitive play.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <h2>Audio and Visuals</h2>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> The game includes sound effects taken from the original Angry Birds game, playing when collisions occur or actions are made by the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> I recreated retro-style visuals, giving the game a similar look and feel to the original while adding my own touch for a unique experience.</li>
            </ul>
