The AI selects random actions from the set of valid moves available at each timestep‚Äîresulting in unpredictable and erratic behaviour. While not intended for competitive play, this demo serves as a proof of concept for integrating AI decision-making into the engine. It also provides a useful baseline for testing animations, input handling, and character responses in a live environment.">

It also features the debug mode toggle, which overlays red hitboxes around characters to visualise active hitboxes and attack collisions in real time. This system ensures that only attacks landing within the defined hitboxes register as hits, providing clear feedback on collision accuracy. Debug mode was essential for testing animation alignment, hit detection, and overall combat responsiveness during development.">

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The game includes two primary modes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player vs Player (PvP):</strong> Both players control characters using the same keyboard, configured in the options menu.</li>
                <li><strong>Player vs AI (Story Mode):</strong> In this mode, you battle against a simple AI that uses random number generation to decide which moves to use. The AI is erratic, making it hard to predict and defeat. It only uses moves that are consistent with its current stance (e.g., no jumping attack while crouched).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Best of 3:</strong> The first player to knock out the other twice wins the match.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Attacks</h2>
        <section class="attacks">
            <p>There are 3 types of attacks in the game:</p>

                <li>Medium</li>
                <li>Heavy</li>

            <p>These attacks can be used while:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Crouched</li>
                <li>Moving Forward</li>
                <li>Moving Backward</li>
                <li>Jumping</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each action results in different effects, ranges, and speeds, making the gameplay dynamic and fun.</p>
