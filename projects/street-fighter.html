        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The game includes two primary modes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player vs Player (PvP):</strong> Both players control characters using the same keyboard, configured in the options menu.</li>
                <li><strong>Player vs AI (Story Mode):</strong> In this mode, you battle against a simple AI that uses random number generation to decide which moves to use. The AI is erratic, making it hard to predict and defeat. It only uses moves that are consistent with its current stance (e.g., no jumping attack while crouched).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Best of 3:</strong> The first player to knock out the other twice wins the match.</p>
        </section>
